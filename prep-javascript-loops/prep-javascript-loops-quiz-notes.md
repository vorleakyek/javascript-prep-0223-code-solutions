## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
o	Determine when to stop it
o	Defines the condition for executing the code block
o	If the return is true, then the loop will start over again
o	If false, the loop will stop

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
o	Executed (one time) before the execution of the code block

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
o	At the beginning of each iteration

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
o	Executed (every time) after the code has been executed
o	The final expression evaluated before entering the condition
o	Increment >> check the condition

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
o	Increments the value of the initial variable

- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
